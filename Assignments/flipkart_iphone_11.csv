muddassar shaikh,Highly recommended,5,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !READ MORE"

Mohammed Aslam,Mind-blowing purchase,5,First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don‚Äôt think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

Arun R,Very poor,5,"Reviewing again after 5 months. At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...READ MORE"
Zeeshan Chowdhury,Classy product,5,Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems.

sayyed shoieb,Just wow!,5,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

Shane  Gidian,Excellent,5,"Seller - SuperComNet ( my trust in you has grown deeper. Thanks for the genuine product ) The package came packed perfectly. The box was sealed which gave me a big relief. Apple needs no introduction since its the dominant market player. I just love the way how IPhone 11 stands out so boldly. The moment I took it out from the box, I could feel the premium intensity. The body is remarkable and crafted for giving you a elite vibe. Camera is to die for. There is no other phone that can beat...READ MORE"

Irfan Tamboli,Pretty good,4,"Have been using for the last 2 weeks. The only con would be the display which is way inferior than the oled screens. Rest all is fabulous.

Milind betawadkar,Does the job,3,"Apple is not doing any R&D for making its handset user friendly. Though it is small in size it is difficult to handle it with single hand. In this amount others are giving far far better than apple. One of the myth is it never gets lag, but others get after a couple of years. But in a couple of years everyone changes his mobile, than why should we bother about lagging of phone. In a nutshell apple should do a lot for improving its performanceREAD MORE"

Very little and apparently not visible dent on the back of my old phone cost me too much. Old phone was in good and working absolutely. It seems Flipkart has left to the pickup man and given free hand to judge the exchange product. Not good. I strongly object the way my old phone was verified and additional deduction applied.

Amitava Dey,Unbiased Review,5,"I am basically a Samsung S series user. As an app developer, I always wanted to buy an iPhone. Bought this iphone 11. This phone is just a piece of metal.  I don't like holding this cold piece of metal on my hand. With or without a back cover this phone is too bulky. Not sure which metal they used to build it, it feels heavy. My Samsung s9 is way better then this. Sorry iPhone, I can't use it daily. I'll use it occasionally, just to show off.READ MORE"
