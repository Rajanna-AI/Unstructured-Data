18,Mohammed Aslam,Mind-blowing purchase,5,First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don‚Äôt think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...READ MORE"
24,Zeeshan Chowdhury,Classy product,5,Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems.
